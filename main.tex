\section{Introduction}

This document contains my evolving narrative of metascience.

\section{The Narrative}

% What causes success?
What gives rise to a high-impact career?
Some schools of thought range from the Matthew Effect (success begets success) to the random impact rule (success happens at random times) to the hot streak effect (a combination of the two, where successes happen in succession but the beginning success is distributed randomly; e.g. \citealt{Liu2018).
\textbf{Can the random locations be explained by movement within the topographical model, where a person's direction takes them into a high-impact susceptible area?} 
Others focus on the novelty or conventionality of work, or a combination of work~\citep[e.g.][]{Uzzi2013}.

% When (on what timescale) does success occur?
Identifying individuals that may be successful is the subject of much work, including \cite{Sinatra2016}, who note the ``increasing desire to identify early promising scientists''.
\textit{To me the desire to identify early promising scientists seems genius-heavy, which at least leaves a sour taste in my mouth, regardless of accuracy.}
